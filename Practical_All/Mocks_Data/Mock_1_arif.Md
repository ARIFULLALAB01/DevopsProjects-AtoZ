 *  Self introduction and roles and responsibilities

* 1)	just get your resume so I have your uh resume here um so we can go through this and you can brief me a bit about your experience what your course core skills are and we can take it from there eah so let me give you a brief intro 
about myself so my name is saying having close to the nine years of experience till date there is a bit of background noise that I hear is it uhI am at yeah someone's place and everybody is working from home okay then allow me two minutes let me go to another place okay years this is for the senior devops engineer role okay yeah okay I'm invisible and audible right now yes so yeah so basically I'm having totally close to nine years of experience as of now till date in IT industry where I started my career as a software engineer training working on industry technology mostly developing websites using PHP as the backend language and we are going forward I upgraded myself or added afront-end skill like just simplifiedcss3 JavaScript jQuery angular react so basically I was a full style developer initially for uh for the initial phrase that is three years and after that upgrade myself into cloud computing and coming to Cloud I got opportunity to undergo training and certification for AWS Azure and IBM bluemix but yeah I got an opportunity only to work on on AWS platform as an application engineer or Cloud engineer mostly engage in the migration activities and during this day they had during the cloud journey I got an opportunity  for a project where the Devops practice was to be in individually implemented from there starts my Devops journey and till date I am working as a Core devops engineer coming to devops initially started with[Music][Music]I've been associated with banks so I got exposed up to the security part also so hence as of now I'm working as a desktops engineer you can see okay  I'm coming to current profile currently working for uh HDFC Banken genderland the rules and responsibilities in include mostly pretty much they are similar to other works Engineers apart from uh we are considering the security practice over our devops platform so kay so 


2)	first one quick question um I got a good Good idea about your profile how about this sort of transition like from Standard Charter to HDFC uh so usually uh the Indian Banks they don’t have that uh digital presence or you know you can say not Sowell for fast paced kind of banks so and and also the salary part like washtfc able to meet your salary and all other stuff and yeah see they said yeah this is another story when I uh opted or when I decided to move from SCB so I had a multiple offers like um not from India I had offers from abroad also and I had planned or uh the plan for which I moved out of STD was just to go abroad but at the last stage you know due to family issues constant and all I could not make it although I had everything with me the Visa also started but I have to end it and at that point of time I got a offer from HDFC and the text that we were talking about Indian bank I was one hour of Indian mines don't have that extra but in HDFC these people they just had started two new verticals that is digital Factory and EnterpriseOne July 2021 it had been around 8 or 10months when I was interviewed after foreign they're thinking that only I joined HDFC and the other decision was correct and the salary part was taken care yeah yeah salary they gave a good salary like good hike thinking okay cool 

3)All right so uh we will get into the discussion so brief like basic questions what what’s your understanding of Devsecops maybe devsecops if you can explain we can take it from there okay that's the Devsecops is not a technology or it's not a textile rather it's a practice which is implemented over multiple organization and coming to multiple organization it is not specific to uh any category maybe uh fintech maybe any bank or maybe e-commerce but that that's a cop should be imposed or should be imposed to each and every organism irrespective of the domain there are multiple benefits out of which leads to a formation of a security layer over your organization structure the second one having a security gate and a chances of possibilities are there when the major part of any organization is the data is compromised by various means so yeah that can be prevented via Dev supports third one is performance agility and obviously the last one again the security of your whole infrastructures so 
4) what  do you mean by devsecops in in this whole phenomenon and how do you accomplish that okay set up significance uhthe bridge between uhyour security and operations ideally the bridge between the developer and operation is being filled by devops and and security coming to addI can say to add cream on the cake .

5)so that way I can Define okay so any specific tools that you have used to enable the security so with God grace I can say I got an opportunity with the leader with whom am working as of now he gave me a freehand in driving tool name as check marks which is used to scan the vulnerabilities so from HDFC point of view for our vertical I am the single point of contact who is a collaborative working since last year with the vendor in driving this checkmarks it started all with the on-premise and now we have moved to a cloud SAS model and the scan types include your SAS your SCA and now we have included kicks also which I am may not say the single point of contact but I am the single point of failure for sonar Cube but for checkmarks I am single part of quantities of now we haven't any point of failure yet okay those
6) two yeah two tools we are using so did you evaluate check marks comparing with some other product how was this decision made on
when I joined just two months ago this channel was made the check marks would be on Reddit um already it was being onboarded to bank but to our vertical it was me who on board it is Ideally okay so ideally our responsibilities was thatch we as a devsecops engineer we should only help to integrate those two in our pipeline that was the major responsibility but as it was an open playground and uh there was no restriction and I took I have responsibilities and write it or right okay 
7) Any specific benefits that have come through any you can quantify using check marks: these are parameters would have come into picture before making the decision of onboarding into bank but uh coming to your question what has been the benefit of was using this as user point of view I can say it's pretty can say straightforward and pretty flexibility for any users they can the integration was the in although the integration was a little complex or added twist but yeah consuming those from a user point of view it's pretty straightforward and they can generate the report yeah which again based on the approval can take ahead with the release process or with the further process but what is the benefit you have got after integrating this tool okay the benefit is that we check as a fee we haven't integrated over the pipeline apart from that we have all also integrated in the IDE plugins of the developer assume me as a developer who is developing umare 
8)you saying you have not integrated in the pipeline yet on a pipeline they’re not in the bank environment or not in the in the devops environment rather in the developer environment and when they are pushing to our environment then our pipeline takes care because you know pipeline is already integrated what are the benefits you have received so far with this tool we have received we have three of application so 
9) so that's the primary thing of what kind of issues has this reported do you remember any specific or any type of issues that it reports see there are multiple scan categories under checkmarks uh chatting from SAS which is source code application then uh HCI sources composition analysis and gigs so multiple features are multiple vulnerabilities comes under different categories for SAS it inspire-built like until unless your application is built you can have a standing under sash category for coming into HCA when your application is built you need few dependencies libraries or few third party libraries which helps inbuilding your application okay so that comes under source code which means analysis so okay so it’s composition into analysis third one is the kids which points to a repository in so in our bank we have a single pointed repository or a standardized repository where our Helm charts Docker file resides so that is taken care by kids so the main advantage of this is that we are we are sanitizing the application completely we are scanning the vulnerability we are fixing the availabilities at a very granular stage
10) give me one or two example of these vulnerabilities see it depends again okay I can say as of now recently I  got one from a specific project it was from a Docker file scanning the docker file wire kicks so it had multiple original Three multiple errors the first being those people are but those project team they haven't met the standard awesome of creating the docker file like in bank we have created a standard of creating a Docker file so there are numerous points we are starting from the size in using the standard or basic images these are all the few points which we have set as the best practices of creating a Docker file or a Docker image so so these people they haven't met such that's very basic right standard not followed seven looking at with your eyes or just a code review can can get those kind of issues okay but then again it's a manual approach right yeah 
11) what is that SC what is the tool check marks has reported any such vulnerabilities typically we get so many issues right you must be scanning your mobile applications or your web applications Docker file any two or three like what happens in in our environment if we get some specific issue we get like 10 or 20 or 50 times that issue like this issue is at line 50 in this file then another file what are those top anything that comes to your mind that this tool helps with.?
 so previously uh I got uh one report uh going through one report uh it was yeah one developer they have crafted the credentials that drafted the credential guess I could not remember it was I guess DB name or some credentials I I'm not sure for which exactly but they have yeah I integrated the username and password including the token number so that was highlighted on the second or third point again very special very like even a basic code review would have revealed that again not something es tool helps but no no you exactly I do understand your point something that everything with the Naked Eyes you can't easily detect or uh a tool would probably be abetter fit for that but leave the tool what are the top security issues in general in the there are 10 categories or these guys follow see inside checkmarks they have That I could not pronounce it o w a s p so that can uh yeah the check marks have been integrated or they so if you if you say follow this standard they would bring those rules  are already different organization right so when the scan initiate uh it makes sure that the vulnerabilities which are being thrown out or this can present and are being aligned with those standard or policies right if not then obviously it will be reported okay so
 12) what are those policies any any idea what  those I haven't buy headed it to be honest so 

13) what happens when you receive an issue your pipeline reports or what’s the workflow okay so before conveying the workflow let me give you a short background we have a team here like a governance team that is is from our Devsecopes point of view our work ends on integrating the pipeline and generating the report post that the developer team needs to take this report and have a clearance from the isg team okay so this is the workflow and coming to uh the technology and we have integrated not only to only initiate the scan in the pipeline rather we have is the logic in such a way that once the pipeline finishes we have set two more adult enhancement which I just had a release last week only uh like we have said the quality threshold will get for session HD as of now kicks is not yet being integrated uh or being released for Sash and HCA I have said the quality threshold go uh based on the I discussion so assume I have set a five or ten number availabilities to be passed for my Dev environment or for my broad environment so if it breaches 10or 5 the pipeline will abort the stage will abort and it will Aborte the pipeline also got it but yeah but the report will be generated and it will be shared to specific number of email but it is  to specific number of email users which are being drafted or which have been part of our Jenkinson file we we have completely influenced parameters and here we follow the shared lead structure we have integrated this over our pipeline okay by creating of shared label so that as a user if you consume you can directly invoke the function on our Jenkins period if you are good to consume our scan okay
14) so give me like some more details as Tou anything around highly available applications how do you ensure one application is highly available and yeah some something around that well that was yeah that that doesn’t comes in our pocket here in current organization the reason being it's Avery good organization and we have a separate Clause of a cloud of vertical for it okay so we are a centralized Devsecops team okay who's  mostly responsible or primary responsibilities to create framework or platform that can be consumed across the Bank in order to integrate their application into that second so if some application uh has to be architected 
15) your team will not be involved in from intra point of view also o your profile says you have used terraform and civil so does that fall into your responsibilities but we haven't architected it rather we have created few modules for one of the project at a very initial share like last year only I did but after that the project which are coming to our onboard themselves into depth of course they have their own infra guy who have created the modules but we make sure that they follow the standardization which we have set like we have our own repository structure and they need to push their code in that like mostly in sort of banks till date they have out sour ceded everything in the take part and now we are building an in-house community 
16)are you certified you said you are certified on few stuffed past:
 I did for AWS developer associate as of now planning for kubernetes mostly by next month I will be doing that okay all right uh
17) Do you understand the cloud well architected framework yeah  in past organization I I got exposure to this so can you explain like what is what do you mean by 3 Tier architecture it depends like unlike can you be you know more specific into which type of design like there isa standard term industry term actually well architected frame work so what are those pillars of well architecture uh that you usually follow and see
Mostly what I have came across is the  3- Tier application Network Android database layer so theatre architecture what I have heard and what I have come across till date in my developer and both devops technique okay can you explain 
18) what is three-tier architecture you combines your application layer your networking layer and your database layer your application layer to comprises of your all source code which are required to build your application and your network layer and just signifies the piece of apart on cake which allows you to have a connection between can say a source and destination or between two layers and coming to your database layer which is more significant it comprises of all your can say the exact keyword for is this all your sensitive information or your sensitive data okay to be stored at a place you can turn that as a database what three architecture layer these are for application for infrastructures you said this this is a three-tier architecture this is for an application for any application or can say any new project if it comes up first we ask what is your codes uh one layer followed by networking and followed by secrets like umsay this three should be the category of application yeah that is one more layer which is called as user interactive layer or uh that makes it four tier architecture so it's a three-tier cost is the user interactive layer then the second one is the application layer uh which comprises of this networking and database also inside that as a subcategory and uh the last is I guess the network layer I I could not Recology but yeah these two I Can recall that is the user interactive layer and the application layer okay
19) do you know what is public subnet private subnets yeah in Cloud app what is the difference between these two that this is public this is private no no uh see the thing is that uh the one thing which is a distinguished or make it differentiate is uh from a public subnets used which can be accessed globally okay without any restrictions okay that is the basic difference but coming from from if I want to store my sensitive information definitely I will not go with the public because that will become promised like my data will be compromised right or that is that is not the difference what is the key difference that is the reason to have a public and private subnets because this is the basic uhthe main reason why you should have public work then yeah that is correct main reasons to have but what is the key difference between a public subnet and a private subnet  As for my experience anything from routes or networking point of view in publicit is two-way accessible but in private it is means one way like a unidirectional and bi-directional I can say okay all right 
20) have you performed any disaster recovery in your environment to be honest current didn't in past also I could not because pastors also alive so we did only POC but I don't know that was integrated or not because by that time I left over

21) you are mainly on AWS rightokay
we have here AWS and gcp including Azureso we are not any Cloud specific okay
22)have you ever engaged into cost optimization activity
last quarter I was engaged on a cost of optimization but it was related only to Jenkins live agent not for any projector not for in this thing but it was a small POC where uh the Jenkins agent which we is being hosted on which we are using as of now for our vertical how 
23) how you do and how can we cost optimize
it by various considering this various parameters that was up you see although so what what was your recommendation our recommendation was because currently it was on premise so we have to give a strong justification uh to offer GCP one so so those premise we the developers even we when we try to execute job on our general platform we face with a lot of issues like for the basic issues the node not  available execute is not available and  in most cases it takes time delay to execute the pipeline although we have optimize everything on our Jenkins file but still it takes a lot of time so those are a few things uh a few parameters based on which we went ahead with the cost optimization 
24) any difference between these two or three different types of load balancers uh AWS offers or aureus AWS 
I can say but I remember uh classic application load balancer and network load balancer mostly we I have come across application load balance what is the difference between these three see application load balancer I have actually used have been in touch with uh in my past experience so application load balances comes into picture or has its benefits  of a path based routing so previously before coming into the bank domain I was part of a startup it was mostly an-commerce platform so we had multiple modules on microservices for our website so there we have we were using ALB uh so that you can configure or we can root based on the module path which can result enhances uh the traveling handling I can say so that's uh the best part of that's the benefit of using lb increases the performance and handles the traffic based on the user request but NLB also supports Pathways that's not the major difference between these As of now I can recall this and I can okay
25)in your environment how are you managing the secrets as of now ?
we have been secret using Vault uh or in Jenkins we are creating the Jenkins Keystone but we are not the support or we are not the right uh Team or yeah we are not the right team who are taking the ownership of the Jenkins too rather we have a Dev supports a vertical who takes care of the ownership of these tools like git and Jenkins Or son RQ we only consume their services so we recommend to have a key store to store the credentials over Jenkins and for this Kubernetes we use secrets
26) have you designed any solution system design system design 
I can say not individually end to end but rather part of the system design 
27)anything you recall new anything you have you have been part of which was designed recently but recently 
not but in past yeah during the initial phase of my current organization and on my previous organization previous organization on the mid uh we I was part of the designed to end uh it was a migration project from on-premise to Cloud with integration of the other circles 
28) what was the approach for the migration and what was your role in that ?
My role was from devops point of view because we had already a cloud architecture there who gave or who transformed the on-premise architecture he Legacy architecture into cloud with the various uh AWS services so we are the Devopspoint of view we consume their uhendpoints in our services and allow the end user to consume our Dev supports platform so me as a devops engineer we automated or we created a framework which will of sticker which will consumer page the application from their source code Repository scanning those secreting a build brokering it pushing into for Docker image scanning post that they're flowing into a specific namespace this was a end-to-end framework created by me and my two team members in my past organization
29)were you involved in any discovery of resources on-premor was it just automation I uh no I was just in the path automation okay all right I think that is pretty much I wanted to discussed you have any questions yeah
 30)I have few if you allow me yeah please yeah thanks uh so just wanted to check as I am already being conveyed by the person who have scheduled this interview or pass this the platform for us to connect so just wanted to ask about what exactly because uh as I know that the Capital One is also in bank so what will take stack like how can I differentiate between uh what text tag or what environment I'm working as of now on what environment is their setup for your organization with respect to tools technology everything so 

I think we have tried giving as much details possible on a job description as well we are also multi-cloud what other Tech stack same docker containerization Kubernetes terraform and civil pretty much that you probably would have been working on or or as a devops engineer have some understanding so the tech stack is uh play test we try to look at senior engineer senior devops Engineers to provide feedback and make changes to our Tech stack so we need we need that kind of profile aswell Okay 
31)so what was your other question regarding the work location or like in Bangalore do you have about it's specific to any state or no nothing like that we are pretty open we have people uh coming working from remote locations as wells so we are so people who are in Bangalore we have office and they do join office on weekly or any such uh major occasion when it's required but cool as of now we are into that mixed mode if people are yeah so if they are remote they want to work from home they are we are flexible on that so you provide the remote work options also yes at least for now at least it’s open right now there is no restriction okay so it's it's not permanent but yeah correctly correct because Capital One has uh different uh offices we have offices in electronic City and in the airport as well you have one near the airport and the second one electronic City pkey yeah 
32)one last question with respect to the security tools uh will it be fine if you can unshared uh which state which exactly security tools being in use or consumed by digital devops platform we use multiple tools not restricted to any specific tool that’s why most of my questions who are not about tool as such they all have what we have found is they share similar sort of reports so what does it was same but as it was onboarded and you know was working in Bank environment if you work with senior stakeholder people who are quite senior and experienced and they have a long dinner event they don't go directly for the change or they don't adopt the change at fast pace as we do in it organizations that's the reason that the major digital or that's a fact we haven't went to other tools rather we have done POC for 45 also and for one other tool it was white suiting or something I forgot those two were done and we took it ahead with the same stakeholders but that didn't work out because it is already onboarded and the governance team or the finance team they directly they encountered on generally they rejected that this tool is already we have onboarded and if we are going to onboard anyone it will take at least six to eight months has advantage that um it's it has an self-hosted version as well for a single tenant which is dedicated to HDFC right rights that's not a restriction over here we try to you look at Capital One history we have been developing in-house uh software’s and making them open source not sure you look at hijia dashboard that was developed by Capital One and outsourced made it open source that's a dashboard that connects to different devsecops tools and give you a very holistic View of the environment that's a open source project now so yeah so we have a bunch of In-House tools and also multiple tools depending upon which area we are connected within the bank okay that's that's cool then then you don’t have much restrictions like times like you have restrictions but uh you have transformed them into a healthy culture or a healthy environment where one can get an open environment too okay but not really open by their choice but by the type of application they are working okay got it got it here also we are following same and we are hired or my managers are but uh a thing which I learned in one year here in current organization things won’t change as as you want especially in bank and if it is a big inorganization it takes time and things move very slowly but yeah but again we are trying to set up something which we may see after couple of years that's a pretty much all right I’ll close the interview for now and then I’ll share the feedback with the HRsure thank you nice talking to you thanks
